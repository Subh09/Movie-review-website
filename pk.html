<div>PK is as much a philosophy as a film. It takes the 'stranded alien' theme, familiar from
 classics like ET, but tells the tale equally from the lonely alien's eyes - at times, evoking
 the beautiful story The Little Prince - as from his human narrator's. Starting with the alien's
 desperation, PK captures the fears and falsehoods humans weave around faith. When PK decides to
 pray for his remote, he's bewildered about whom to and how to pray. PK features brave scenes -
 money extracted at temples, coconuts offered in confusion at a church, god-men doling out
 tortuous advice - and strong lines, including a Muslim girl bravely asserting, "Itna chota nahin
 ho sakta hamara khuda, ki use hamare school jaane pe aitraaz ho." Capturing faith whipped into
 hate, PK's sterling message, directed sensitively, stands out.
 As does Aamir Khan as the wide-eyed alien bemused by human life, a paan-chomping Chaplin from
 outer space, liked by rustic Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt in a warming cameo). PK's simplicity
 contrasts with Jaggu's complicated life, heartbroken after she thinks her Pakistani boyfriend
Sarfaraz (Sushant) ditched her in chocolate-box Belgium. Tapasvi warned Jaggu's father
 (Parikshet Sahani) that her Muslim lover would betray her - does PK prove him wrong?
 Anushka presents a sprightly show while Boman Irani stands out as a TV channel head. Some
 supporting acts and special effects could've been sharper though while at points, editor Raju
 Hirani should've been sterner with director Raju Hirani in trimming tighter scenes. Between
 gods, frauds, love and bombs, there are multiple threads here. Some distract, others impact,
 like PK hilariously dazed by humans hiding when they make out - except when they announce it
 with band-baaja on their wedding day.</div>
