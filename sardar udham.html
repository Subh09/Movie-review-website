                    <div>The film follows a non-linear narrative, going back and forth from the present, where Sardar
                        Udham Singh is in London, to his past when he was part of the Hindustan Socialist Republican
                        Association (HSRA) and explores his reasons for assassinating Indian Civil Service officer
                        Michael O'Dwyer. Udham (known as Sher Singh) is released from prison at Punjab in British India.
                        He is constantly being watched by the colonial authorities. He leaves India and goes to the USSR
                        during what appears to be winter. From there, he makes his way to London by ship. Even though
                        the British authorities are on the lookout for him, he successfully evades them and lives in
                        London, making a living as a salesman and then a welder. He is shown in front of Caxton Hall,
                        making his way inside where O'Dwyer is giving a speech on his time as Lt. Governor of Punjab and
                        how he had suppressed a major uprising. Udham makes his way to O'Dwyer and shoots him, and is
                        arrested.

                        Udham is appointed a lawyer who slowly gets Udham to tell his backstory. Udham is brought to
                        court and in spite of a good lawyer, the judges sentence him to death. Upon hearing this, Udham
                        makes an impromptu speech where he denounces British rule in India and reaffirms his support for
                        the Indian freedom movement. Udham protests the conditions of his detention and goes on a 42-day
                        fast, but is force-fed to break it. He slowly opens up to the investigating inspector and tells
                        him the reasons for the assassination. Udham also got the title of Shaheed-E-Azam.

                        In 1919, Udham is a young adult working in a textile mill near Amritsar, with a girlfriend who
                        is mute. On 13 April 1919, in favour of O'Dwyer, General Dyer opens fire on a crowd of 20,000
                        peaceful protestors inside Jallianwala Bagh. Udham is sleeping unaware of the massacre, until
                        his friend wakes him up, mortally wounded and bleeding profusely. He hears about the massacre
                        and rushes to the grounds to help. It is shown that along with a few other volunteers, Udham
                        finds survivors and gets them to a makeshift hospital which is overwhelmed itself. He is later
                        executed and shown to have a photo of Bhagat Singh, taken when Bhagat was in prison during his
                        final days.

                        After the independence of India, Udham's ashes are brought to the country upon the request of
                        Punjab Chief Minister Giani Zail Singh, and were immersed in the Sutlej river. His ashes were
                        immersed in the same place as his idol, Bhagat. In the final scene, Dyer and O'Dwyer give their
                        own accounts to the Hunter Commission.</div>
