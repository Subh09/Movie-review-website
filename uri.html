                    <div>URI - The Surgical Strike is based on the 2016 Indian Army's surgical strikes on Pakistan
                        Administered Kashmir as retaliation for the Uri attack. Directed by debutant Aditya Dhar, the
                        movie is a harrowing adventure behind the headlines that is at once a riveting procedural and,
                        at the same time, a bracing political statement on the war based on terror. The movie succeeds
                        in generating enormous tension by dramatizing a recent historical event in spite of the fact
                        that everyone knows how it will end.

                        On 18 September 2016, four heavily armed militants attacked on Indian security forces near the
                        town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir. Film URI chronicles the events of the surgical strike. The
                        fictional story based on this true event recounts the fatal operation which was carried out in
                        2016.The movie is divided into five chapters that lead to the finale of surgical strike. Major
                        Vihan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal), a brave and determined officer, is grappling with personal
                        tragedy. Govind (Paresh Rawal), an Indian intelligence & law enforcement officer, appoints Vihan
                        for the highly secretive operation of surgical strike thatâ€™s planned under the guidance of PM
                        Narendra Modi (Rajit Kapur). It's up to Vihan and his special team force to accomplish this
                        daredevil mission. Will they succeed?</div>
